# spearmint-unofficial-patch-data
An unofficial package containing missing resources for zturtleman's spearmint-patch-data

How do you use this patch data?
Set up zturtleman's patch data for the demoq3/demoq3test as usual, then copy the pak1.pk3 for the version of the game you want to use in that directory. As a result, all problems related to this will now be fixed (lightning bolt shader, taunt sounds missing, music missing, etc.)
